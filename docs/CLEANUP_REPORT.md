# MeyVeda Codebase Cleanup & Migration Report

This report summarizes the files relocated, deprecated helpers deleted, and validation results compiled during the codebase refactoring.

---

## 1. Relocated Directories & Files

All server-side files were moved from `src/server/` to the consolidated `src/backend/` namespace:
*   `src/server/controllers/*` → `src/backend/controllers/*`
*   `src/server/services/*` → `src/backend/services/*`
*   `src/server/repositories/*` → `src/backend/repositories/*`
*   `src/server/validation/*` → `src/backend/validation/*`
*   `src/server/errors/*` → `src/backend/errors/*`
*   `src/server/middleware/*` → `src/backend/middleware/*`

The duplicate profile DDD service structure was merged:
*   `src/services/profile-service/api/*` → `src/backend/controllers/profile.controller.ts`
*   `src/services/profile-service/application/*` → `src/backend/services/profile.service.ts`
*   `src/services/profile-service/infrastructure/*` → `src/backend/repositories/profile.repository.ts`
*   `src/services/profile-service/domain/profile.rules.ts` → `src/backend/services/profile.rules.ts`
*   `src/services/profile-service/validation/*` → `src/backend/validation/profile.schema.ts`
*   `src/services/profile-service/dto/*` → `src/backend/dto/profile.dto.ts`
*   `src/services/profile-service/types/*` → `src/backend/types/profile.types.ts`

Diagnostic root scripts were moved into `src/test/scripts/`:
*   `find_doctor.ts` → `src/test/scripts/find_doctor.ts`
*   `check_doctor_availability.ts` → `src/test/scripts/check_doctor_availability.ts`
*   `query_db.ts` → `src/test/scripts/query_db.ts`

## 2. Deleted Deprecated Files

The following deprecated and duplicate files were cleaned up after updating all import references across the codebase:
*   `src/lib/supabase.ts` (Re-exported browser client, replaced by direct imports of `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`)
*   `src/lib/supabase-server.ts` (Re-exported server client, replaced by direct imports of `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`)
*   `src/features/appointments/services/appointment-api.service.ts` (Replaced by `appointments-api.client.ts` using the new `apiClient` wrapper)

---

## 3. Compilation & Verification Results

*   **TypeScript Check**: Completed successfully (`tsc --noEmit` exit code 0).
*   **Vitest Unit Tests**: Passed successfully (`npm run test:unit` exit code 0).
*   **Next.js Production Build**: Compiled successfully in Turbopack mode, generating static optimization pages with zero errors.
